                 This is the login dialog if the user is not logged-in yet. If you're using the MySQL database connection to store the connection and user data then the initialization automatically adds the user 'admin' with the password 'admin'. It's recommended to change the password after database initialization. Database initialization is done on the first access to the pages/login dialog after setting up the valid MySQL connection.
