php-virt-control
----------------

The php-virt-control tool is the virtual machine control tool for PHP.
It depends on libvirt PHP bindings as the module for PHP. You can use
the tool to manage your virtual guests you're having available on your
libvirt connection(s).

LANGUAGE LOCALIZATIONS
----------------------

If you're a developer and you're adding a new functionality with new
strings you should use $lang->get($ident) functions instead of coding
in strings directly. The $ident argument is being used as a key of
the array available in the classes/language.php, method initlang(),
which is the default if language cannot match the ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
HTTP header or $trans array in files of lang directory.

The automatic language is being determined from the HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE
variable - the first entry from there before the dash ('-') is being
used. The system is looking for a file named as $thisPart.php in the
lang directory and uses the default from Languages class if it cannot
be found. E.g. for English browser settings the first token is usually
en-US, so the part before dash character is 'en' so this is looking for 
lang/en.php etc.

The language can be changed using the Settings link after you log in.
